# Muslim Prayer Tracker

A new Flutter project for my CS4750, which allows andriod users to quickly and easily view and edit the number of prayers, fasts, etc. which they may have in order to make them up at a later date.

## Motivatins
Background: In Islam it is an obligation to know and follow all five main pillars of Islam: Shahada (profession of faith), Salat (the 5 daily prayers), Zakat (yearly alms towards the poor), Sawm (fasting during Ramadan), and finally Haij (pilgrimage to Mecca). 

Problem: Although we try our best to abide by these pillars, there are times when unforeseen circumstances prevent us from completing some of these obligations (primarily Sawm and Salat). For example if you are sick and cannot fast during Ramadan you are allowed to make up the days you missed any day outside of Ramadan, but must also pay a type special of Zakat known as Zakat el Futrah for each day that is missed (we must pay the equivalent of a single meal). Besides this if an individual misses the morning prayer because they slept-in they will need to remember to make it up at a later time. As such it is important to keep track of the number of days you missed in order to complete the accurate number of make-ups.

Solution: This app strives to to create a simple and efficient way for anyone to quickly record the exact amount of Qadas (seperate tally for each of the 5), Sawm, and Zakat that they need to complete to be caught up with their obligations.
